## How to Contribute
To contribute to the /r/Seattle stylesheet, please follow this general procedure:

1. Fork the repository
2. Make and test your changes
3. Submit a pull request

## Considerations
* Be sure to test your changes against RES Nightmode. If additional changes are needed to support nightmode, prepend your CSS selector with `body.res-nightmode`.

## Coding Style
* Indent with 4 spaces
* Put open curly braces (`{`) on the same line as the CSS selector: `body {`
* Put close curly braces (`}`) on a new line after your rules `}`
* Put a space between the rule name and value: `margin: 0px;`
* One CSS rule per line, please
